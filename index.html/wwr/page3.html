      <h1> Other Popular Dogs</h1>

        <div class = "pibb"> <u><strong>PIBBLE </u></strong>- Pibble has recently gained popularity, and often overshines 
        Jotchua. Whenever they are shown side by side, most people assume Jotchua is a version of 
        Pibble, similarly to the alien species of Geeble. It should be cleared right away that 
        Jotchua, is not, Pibble. Pibble came to fame through the 
        iconic phrase, "Wash my bellah". This has amassed fans from around the world, however 
        I am here to say that Jotchua is way better due to the latin culture Jotchua brings to 
        the table.</div>

        <div class="Geeble"> <u><strong>GEEBLE</strong></u></strong> -
          Geeble is a version of Pibble from another planet that is green. However,
          this is a clever ploy that tricks the consumer mind. It is like how Sun Chips has different
          versions of flavors, making seem like they have a varity. However, underneath is just the same,
          unoriginal flavor even if the bag says "Garden Salad". It tastes the same as any other Sun Chip,
          just with a different coat of paint. Jotchua is not like that. He is the same no matter what,
          often paired with his friend that inspires hope in people. </div>

          <div class = "jot"> <strong>WHY YOU SHOULD CARE</strong>- Other competitors, like Pibble, Geeble, or Jaekook, have taken
        the spot like away from Jotchua. Their online presence is massive compared to Jotchua,
        even if Jotchua has been out for longer. There are reasons Jotchua is still vastly 
        surperior to his competition. Jotchua, who has even been seen along 
        side Geeble, maintains his relevance. The people's love for Jotchua illustrates
        that even after years of the internet cycle pushing out new trends, Jotchua
        remains at the heart of many.  </div>
