    <h2> Davis Hill</h2>
    <p> I grew up in Maryland and recently graduated High School. I have 5 older siblings and I 
        am majoring in Computer Science. I ran Cross Country in school and like to play video games. I am interested in web design and 
    I am excited to learn more about it with you all.  </p>
    <p> I was adopted from China when I was 2 years old. I've been a member of the Church of Latter
        Day Saints since. Four of my sisters are married and my brother is currently on a mission in Vietnam.

    <h2> Do NOT Cut Your Own Hair </h2>
    <p> Before this semester started I wanted to trim the top of my hair. I didn't know buzzers cut hair THAT well. 
        That was a mistake because I had to take my drivers license picture the next day. That meant I also had to meet my new roomates 
        with no hair. I now look like a Chinese Monk and will never be picking up hair razors again.
