            <strong>WHAT THIS PAGE IS ABOUT </strong> - This page is meant to inform people of Jotchua,
            a dog that unites the world. The following information will detail the background of jotchua, 
            Jotchua Con, and why you should care about Jotchua. 

            <br>
            <br>

            <strong> INFO </strong>  - Jotchua, otherwise known as Perro Dinero, has massed a cult following 
            in the online world. In March of 2021, two puppies were put up for adoption in a now
            privated Facebook account. Many posts online edit the main picture of the yellow-furred dog
            into a funny meme. Jotchua became more mainstream when Spanish internet users started
            using the dog, known then as "Perro Dinero" (Money Dog), as their profile pictures. 
            It was said that those who had the dog in their profile they would be awarded money.
            It is unknown whether people actually believed this or wanted to take part in the joke.

            <br>
            <br>

            <strong>Popularity</strong> - Jotchua is popular over the internet. You might have even seen this 
            dog as you scrolled through posts! The reach of Jotchua is outstanding, but like with many things
            in life, things fade overtime. We at Jotchua Inc are here to revitalize the community, 
            spreading our fun times with anyone who is willing to join!

      <h3>[Jotchua Con]</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>JOTCHUA CON</strong> - Jotchua Con is an event that celebrates Jotchua. There is merchandise you 
        can buy, like bags or phone cases to remember your time. It started back in 2016, and While
        very niche, people still come together and have a good time. Dancing and singing is a blast with a 
        dedicated DJ, there is even a quiet place if you want to lay low and play some board games!  
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>WHO CAN ENTER</strong> - Jotchua Con is free, anyone can enter. There is a potluck where you can bring food
        and enjoy other flavors of food as well at no cost. There is even a soup tasting contest that
        is extrememly spicy! There are mild options, of course, if spice isn't your thing. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong> WHAT TO BRING</strong> - Jotchua Con always need more plates and napkins, however do not
        be that person that only brings plates and napkins or we all would be eating paper for dinner.
        Desserts of all kinds are welcome, including pies and cake. Some people have brough tacos, 
        anything edible is welcome. Go to the store and buy a bag of chips, anything works!

      <h3>[Competitors]</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>WHY YOU SHOULD CARE</strong>- Other competitors, like Pibble, Geeble, or Jaekook, have taken
        the spot like away from Jotchua. Their online presence is massive compared to Jotchua,
        even if Jotchua has been out for longer. This website will give you reasons to believe
        Jotchua is better than his competitors. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>PIBBLE</strong> - Pibble has recently gained popularity, and often overshines Jotchua.
        Whenever they are shown side by side, most people assume Jotchua is a version of Pibble, similarly
        to the alien species of Geeble. It should be cleared right away that Jotchua, is not, Pibble.
        They are an entirely different species, with Pibble being a Frenchie, otherwise known as
        a baby french bulldog. Pibble came to fame through the iconic phrase, "Wash my bellah". 
        This has amassed fans from around the world, however I am here to say that Jotchua is way
        better due to the latin culture Jotchua brings to the table. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong> GEEBLE </strong> - As stated earlier, Geeble is a version of Pibble from another planet that is green. However,
          this is a clever ploy that tricks the consumer mind. It is like how Sun Chips has different
          versions of flavors, making seem like they have a varity. However, underneath is just the same,
          unoriginal flavor even if the bag says "Garden Salad". It tastes the same as any other Sun Chip,
          just with a different coat of paint. Jotchua is not like that. He is the same no matter what,
          often paired with his friend that inspires hope in people.
