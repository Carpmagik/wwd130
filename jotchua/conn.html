        <div class = "conn"> <u><strong> Origins and Location </strong> </u> - Jotchua Con is an event that celebrates Jotchua.
             There is merchandise you can buy, like bags or phone cases to remember your time. It started back 
             in 2016, and while niche, people still come together and have a good time. The original founders
             were a group of Mexican friends that came together and taped up Jotchua Con Posters around. It only gained 
             popularity from there. Dancing and singing 
             is a blast with a dedicated DJ, there is even a quiet place if you want to lay low and play some board 
             games! The event is being held at <u>1234 Spark Street, Electri City, LA 90210 </u>. It's in the 
             Thunder Volt Recreation Center.
