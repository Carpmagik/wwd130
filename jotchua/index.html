        <div class="box">Jotchua, otherwise known as Perro Dinero, has massed a cult following 
            in the online world. In March of 2021, two puppies were put up for adoption in a now
            privated Facebook account. Many posts online edit the main picture of the yellow-furred dog
            into a funny meme. Jotchua became more mainstream when Spanish internet users started
            using the dog, known then as "Perro Dinero" (Money Dog), as their profile pictures. 
            It was said that those who had the dog in their profile they would be awarded money.
            It is unknown whether people actually believed this or wanted to take part in the joke.</div>
