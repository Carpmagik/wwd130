            <div class="info"> <u><strong> Who is Jotchua </strong> </u> - Jotchua, otherwise known as Perro Dinero, 
        has massed a cult following in the online world. In March of 2021,
        two puppies were put up for adoption in a now privated Facebook account.
        Many posts online edit the main picture of the yellow-furred dog into a funny meme.
        Jotchua became more mainstream when Spanish internet users started using the dog, known 
        then as "Perro Dinero" (Money Dog), as their profile pictures. It was said that those who 
        had the dog in their profile they would be awarded money. It is unknown whether people actually 
        believed this or wanted to take part in the joke. <br> <br> <br>
        <u> <strong>Who is his Friend</strong></u> - The other dog, Jotchua's friend, is less known but
        just as cute. The two dogs are inseparable and are often seen together in videos and pictures that 
        have been photoshopped. The original post of Jotchua's friend shows the dog hugging a piece
        of bamboo. Editors online have altered the image so instead the two dogs are hugging each other.
        People online have named him Jaekook, a name originating from Japan. Internet users have adored this duo
        ever since their post went viral.  </div>
